> **Swift** **Github** **MVVM**


Welcome to our second peer lab event!

## What is Peer Lab

You might want to ask, what is the **Peer Lab**, here is the description from [PeerLab community site](http://peerlab.community/)

> ### A Space to Work and Learn

> Here's the idea: come join other developers for a peer-based collaborative learning lab. You've got a question? Maybe someone can provide you with some insight. Maybe you can help someone else with their questions. Bring a laptop and some code to work on.

This idea already exist in my mind for ages, it's also the core mind-set of our Tooler project, to help each other. And to create this kind of event makes me feel happy and grateful.

I hope you guys will like this.

## Update

Today's Peer Lab, we're trying to work on [ManutMood](https://github.com/oaleeapp/ManutMood) project, which is an app will record one's voice and analyze it, then tell you about the emotion states you've got.

We're using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) to manage our dependencies, and help each other set up the project.

Include how to use terminal to work with git and github.

Besides the Swift project, we also talked about MVVM, the design pattern of iOS development,

For the design patterns in iOS, here is recommended resources:

[Core iOS Application Architectural Patterns](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/224/)
[Advanced iOS Application Architecture and Patterns](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/229/)

and something about git:

[git guide](http://www.bootcss.com/p/git-guide/)

and terminal command
