Welcome to our first peer lab event!

## What is Peer Lab

You might want to ask, what is the **Peer Lab**, here is the description from [PeerLab community site](http://peerlab.community/)

> ### A Space to Work and Learn

> Here's the idea: come join other developers for a peer-based collaborative learning lab. You've got a question? Maybe someone can provide you with some insight. Maybe you can help someone else with their questions. Bring a laptop and some code to work on.

This idea already exist in my mind for ages, it's also the core mind-set of our Tooler project, to help each other. And to create this kind of event makes me feel happy and grateful.

I hope you guys will like this.
